                <h2>INTRODUCING ME</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>I am currently working as a marketing specialist in B2B marketing but have grand aspirations to take on more work in the UX/UI field. Although I'm currently based in Chicago, I'm actually a mid-west transplant, originally from the great (not state) of Washington, DC. My family, and maybe more importantly, my dog still live in DC so I go back often and still think that city is one of the best in the world.</p>
                        <p>I firmly believe that creativity is a skill that can be learned and cultivated so I enjoy picking up new creative hobbies from learning instruments, writing short stories, painting, crocheting, and interior design. Currently, I am learning how to sew and practicing my mind-practice connection by trying to figure out how to make things I think up without a specific pattern. I enjoy learning new things and fleshing out new ideas, what they might look like, and how to actually execute them, something that has been very helpful as I've tried to get as much storage and utility out of my 8x8 bedroom as possible.</p>
                        <p>Nothing excites me more than a new project so, if you'd like to work together, shoot me a message and let's get in touch!</p>
